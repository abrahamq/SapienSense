Juan Pablo easily establishes rapport with an amiable manner and natural curiosity for the opinions of others. Research participants rapidly sense that he is a listener, genuinely interested in each and every opinion so answers tend to go beyond the surface. Post session feedback from recruiters is telling: “.. the group didn’t want to leave/ they seem to have fun talking/ they really enjoyed it.” A non-directive approach added to his enthusiasm to hear from everyone, generates rich feedback.  Juan has the knack to elicit feelings and uncover actionable, strategic insights. Juan holds a B.Sc. in Psychology from Universidad de los Andes in Bogotá, Colombia and has moderated hundreds of focus groups, IDI’s and ethnographies in CPG and Pharma/ Healthcare (OTC, DTC, Rx). A native Spanish speaker, he is likewise bicultural. Having learned English as a child, he went on to earn a Proficiency in English Diploma with Honors from the University of Michigan. He is a strategic thinker in his area of expertise: Testing and nourishing communication effectiveness, which he defines as stopping power and emotional engagement to build brand advocacy, the holy grail of modern marketing.
